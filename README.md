  Here's a step-by-step guide on how to deploy your Sui contracts and obtain the SWAP_PACKAGE_ID:

  Prerequisites:

  Before you begin, ensure you have the Sui CLI installed and configured. If not, you can follow the official Sui documentation for installation:
  https://docs.sui.io/guides/developer/getting-started/sui-install (https://docs.sui.io/guides/developer/getting-started/sui-install)

  You should also have a funded Sui address configured in your CLI (e.g., on Testnet or Devnet).

  Step-by-Step Deployment Guide:

   1. Navigate to the Sui Move Package Directory:
      Open your terminal and change your current directory to the root of your sui-1inch project. This is where your sources directory (containing
  my_token.move and swap.move) is located.

   1     cd /Users/xxx/gemini/072525/sui-1inch

   2. Create `Move.toml`:
      Your Sui Move package needs a Move.toml file to define its properties. Create a file named Move.toml inside the sources directory
  (/Users/xxx/gemini/072525/sui-1inch/sources/Move.toml) with the following content:

    1     [package]
    2     name = "sui_1inch"
    3     version = "0.0.1"
    4     edition = "2024.beta"
    5 
    6     [dependencies]
    7     Sui = { git = "https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui.git", subdir = "crates/sui-framework/packages/sui-framework", rev = "testnet" }
    8 
    9     [addresses]
   10     sui_1inch = "0x0" # This will be replaced by the deployed package ID

       * Explanation:
           * [package]: Defines the name, version, and edition of your Move package.
           * [dependencies]: Specifies that your package depends on the official Sui Framework. rev = "testnet" means it will use the version of the Sui
             Framework compatible with the current testnet.
           * [addresses]: Declares a named address sui_1inch which will be replaced by the actual deployed package ID after successful deployment. We use 0x0
             as a placeholder for now.

   3. Build Your Sui Move Package:
      From the sui-1inch directory (where you are after step 1), run the build command. This compiles your Move code and checks for any errors.

   1     sui move build --path ./sources

       * Explanation: The --path ./sources argument tells the Sui CLI to look for the Move.toml and source files within the sources subdirectory.

   4. Deploy Your Sui Move Package:
      Once the build is successful, you can deploy your package to the Sui network. This command publishes your Move modules as a package on the blockchain.

   1     sui client publish --gas-budget 100000000 --path ./sources

       * Explanation:
           * sui client publish: The command to publish a Move package.
           * --gas-budget 100000000: Sets the maximum gas fee for the transaction. You might need to adjust this based on network conditions.
           * --path ./sources: Specifies the path to your Move package.

   5. Obtain the `SWAP_PACKAGE_ID`:
      After the sui client publish command executes, you will see a detailed output in your terminal. Look for a line similar to this (the exact format might
  vary slightly, but the key is Package ID):

   1     ----- Transaction Effects -----
   2     ...
   3     Created Objects:
   4     - ID: 0x... (Package ID)
   5       Owner: ...
   6       Type: package
   7     ...

      The hexadecimal string next to ID: and labeled (Package ID) is your deployed SWAP_PACKAGE_ID. Copy this ID.

   6. Update `SWAP_PACKAGE_ID` in Project Files:
      Now that you have your deployed SWAP_PACKAGE_ID, you need to update the placeholder in your project's TypeScript files.

       * Open `tests/sui.ts`:
          Replace process.env.SUI_SWAP_PACKAGE_ID || '0x...' with your actual SWAP_PACKAGE_ID.

   1         // tests/sui.ts
   2         const SWAP_PACKAGE_ID = 'YOUR_DEPLOYED_PACKAGE_ID_HERE'; // Replace with the actual ID

       * Open `tests/config.ts`:
          Update the swapPackageId field with your actual SWAP_PACKAGE_ID.

   1         // tests/config.ts
   2         swapPackageId: 'YOUR_DEPLOYED_PACKAGE_ID_HERE', // Replace with the actual ID

       * Update `sources/Move.toml` (Optional but Recommended):
          For consistency, you can also update the sui_1inch = "0x0" line in your sources/Move.toml file to use your deployed package ID. This is useful if
  you plan to deploy dependent modules later.

   1         # sources/Move.toml
   2         [addresses]
   3         sui_1inch = "YOUR_DEPLOYED_PACKAGE_ID_HERE" # Replace with the actual ID

  ---

  Once you have completed these steps, your Sui contracts will be deployed, and your TypeScript files will be configured with the correct package ID,
  allowing you to proceed with testing the integration.
